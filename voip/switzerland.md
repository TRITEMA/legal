## Emergency calls from the cloud

 Tritema is compliant to art. 27 and 28 of Ordinance of 9 March 2007 on Telecommunications Services (OTS) regarding emergency services. About such services the following conditions are met and are accepted by customer during the order process on tritema.ch web site.

 Access local Emergency Services directly from the cloud with Tritema phone numbers is free or charge. Even if the service is supported, due to features and limitations of Voip protocol, it's strongly suggested to have a PRI line to be used for this purpose. In fact, case of "nomad" usage of the service, it is necessary to use a different line for such emergency communications.

Being the VoIP service based on the Internet and therefore depending on network connection, we strongly discourage to use VoIP services for emergency calls. Reachability of numbers infact depends not only on routing but also on the availability of network connection, bandwidth, and environmental conditions. Moreover clients might use our service for receiving incoming calls but configure different trunks for outbound traffic, which belongs to different providers. In that case the outbound calls are routed elsewhere and do not depend on our services.

 For all these above mentioned reasons, there is no guarantee that all the conditions for estabilishing a successful call are met everywhere and everytime using VoIP services and this must be considered when trying to access to emergency services. The client is also aware about risks of using emergency "nomad" services in case of emergency calls.

 The decision to transmit to Swisscom directories central database your details for emergency purpose, depends on customer who explicitly decides that and gives us order and confirmation in order to proceed for such purpose. This can be accomplished by opening an assistance ticket request which is then associated to a request number. In processing such a request  the "nomad" flag is always set for directories and therefore routing and localization are not guaranteed. Requests received by email aren't considered valid for security reasons.

 Regarding routing of emergency calls, Tritema relies on a different registered bakom operator. In particular at this time the operator used for such a service is registered operator nr. 2000770. The operator used may change in the future.

 As per art. 30 of Ordinance of 9 March 2007 on Telecommunications Services (OTS), Tritema is specifying what follows

 Until such time as it is technically possible to correctly route and locate voice transmission via Internet Protocol (VOIP) for all locations, this service shall only be provided for emergency calls originating from the primary location indicated in the subscription contract.

 The customer is aware and accepts these restrictions by ordering the service at Tritema; before completing the order, in fact, the system asks the customer to read and accept all legal restrictions and conditions about the service itself. Such conditions are reported on this page. For emergency calls, the customer shall, as far as possible, use a mean of communication that technically allows calls to be routed and located correctly.

 Emergency calls may not be interrupted by telecommunication services which have priority over security communication (Art. 90 para. 2).
