## Emergency calls from the cloud

 Access local Emergency Services directly from the cloud with Tritema phone numbers. In-country routing guarantees that emergency calls from your numbers will connect directly to the appropriate Public Safety Answering Point. No need to maintain a legacy PRI line just in case! We specify that this service is provided through the supplier voxbone which provides the trunks and routing necessary. 

 Being the VoIP service based on the Internet and therefore depending from such a network connection we strongly discourage to use VoIP services for emergency calls. Reachability of numbers infact depends not only on routing but also on the availability of network connection, bandwidth, and environmental conditions. Moreover some clients use our service for receiving calls but use different trunks for outbound ones. In that case the outbound calls are routed elsewhere and do not depend on our services.

 For all these above mentioned reasons, there is no guarantee that all the conditions for estabilishing a successful call are met everywhere and everytime using VoIP services and this must be considered when trying to access to emergency services.
